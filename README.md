## Features

90's Rewind uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, with established GET, POST, and DELETE routes.

The app's database uses MySQL and Sequelize, the pages use Handlebars.js as the template engine, and the app is deployed on Heroku.

90's Rewind has a folder structure that meets the Model-View-Controller paradigm, uses npm express-session and cookies to authenticate logged-in users, and protects key API keys and other sensitive information with environment variables. 

The app uses , a technology not discussed in the boot camp.  

90's Rewind has polished, responsive UI, and accepts and responds to user input.

The app meets good-quality coding standards, and is accompanied by this professional README.
